 - Final Project Abstract: To better understand disease, scholars reviewing the coronavirus pandemic have initiated a movement around the world to map and trace the network of disease across the globe. These visualizations have helped bring new perspectives to scholarly ideas regarding disease and their mobility. The goal of this project is to document the mobility of disease networks in the late Ottoman Empire of the 19th century. By visualizing the origins of pandemics like cholera, plague and animal diseases, this project aims to contribute to the growing body of health and medicinal history in the Ottoman Empire and its extent in the Middle East.

- Final Project Abstract: This study intends to contribute to the overall knowledge base about how the form of urban spaces affects the crime rate (objective safety) by analyzing Chicago's urban intersection. For this purpose, we focus on the top ten percent of least safe urban blocks intersection and collect a set of significant attributes (such as the height of the buildings, the width of the streets, and tree canopies) associated with morphological contexts of the intersections in the 50-meter buffer area of 3986 intersections in Chicago. Two primary regression analyses are used to assess the correlation of morphologic features and the objective safety: (1): Linear Least Squares Methods (Ordinary Least Squares and Weighted Linear regression model); (2) Cluster and Factor Analysis. The results will be presented in interactive maps and graphics using Tableau.
This project is in line with my thesis project subject.

- Final Project Abstract: The matter of accessibility to the internet, particularly in the modern era, is an effective factor in community development. However, since ancient times, some races and ages have been deprived of equal access to urban facilities, resulting in negative impacts on their lives. The interactive map will show how much percentage of people of different races and ages have access to the internet in all the states of America.

- Final Project Abstract: Chernobyl Disaster, the historical Ukrainian tragedy of April 26, 1986, was the memorable event of the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant Reactor 4 explosion, known as the largest nuclear accident of both the 20th century and of all history. This disaster led to the displacement of around 300,000 people and resulted in an estimated range of 4,000 to 93,000 deaths. Because of this event’s notoriety and fear bias many people do not understand what exactly happened, the effects from the disaster, or how this relates to and has impacted nuclear power today. Through the use of web mapping, data visualization, and literary review, this project presents both facts and a timeline of events that took place in Chernobyl, Ukraine and the rest of the globe on April 26, 1986. The conclusion then briefly discusses modern nuclear power technologies, locations, and safety in relation to the events of the notorious Chernobyl Disaster.

- Final Project Abstract: Parking shortage has been one of the biggest challenges faced by truck drivers, fleet managers and owner operators for many years The Truck Parking Information Management Systems (TPIMS) project is an innovative multistate effort undertaken by members of the Mid America Association of State Transportation Officials (MAASTO) to address critical truck parking issues affecting regional economic competitiveness and the national freight network's safety and efficiency. To evaluate the performance of the Iowa TPIMS, utilization, demand cycle and reliability are developed and visualized in a dashboard through multidimensional aggregation of parking flow data. Such intuitive tools and results can help agencies evaluate the system and better understand the large dataset to make informed decisions.

- Final Project Abstract: The Consumption of Dairy Milk has decreased by 40% over the past few decades in the United States, while Plant-Based Alternatives are on the rise. This decline has impacted dairy farmers and those that work for them, but cow’s milk still remains the dominant milk in American diets. Where are these changes most noticeable in the U.S. and which states are leading the charge in switching to dairy milk alternatives?
