This is the course repository for the Spring 2022 offering of Landscape Architecture 558: Introduction to Web Mapping
  
In this repo you will find the files to support the exercises, assignments and other course materials. This repo is updated prior to each lecture so student should refresh it regularly. Students can read from this repository, but can't post to it, instead they 
should initially clone this repo to their local computer and then refresh/pull updates prior to each lecture. In addition to this repo, each student will have their own private repo where they will post their assignments and final projects. Following is a list of each student's repo and a brief description of their final project.

- Final Project Abstract: The matter of accessibility to the internet, particularly in the modern era, is an effective factor in community development. However, since ancient times, some races and ages have been deprived of equal access to urban facilities, resulting in negative impacts on their lives. The interactive map will show how much percentage of people of different races and ages have access to the internet in all the states of America.

 - Final Project: 
 - Final Project Abstract: To better understand disease, scholars reviewing the coronavirus pandemic have initiated a movement around the world to map and trace the network of disease across the globe. These visualizations have helped bring new perspectives to scholarly ideas regarding disease and their mobility. The goal of this project is to document the mobility of disease networks in the late Ottoman Empire of the 19th century. By visualizing the origins of pandemics like cholera, plague and animal diseases, this project aims to contribute to the growing body of health and medicinal history in the Ottoman Empire and its extent in the Middle East.

- Final Project: 
- Final Project Abstract: The United States is home to over 400 National Parks scattered around the country. These parks each come with a unique landscape and story that bring millions of people to them each year. With each park offering different sights and services, this project aims to discover which parks are the most popular and what they have to offer.

- Final Project: 
- Final Project Abstract: The project focuses on the exported goods from the United States of America to the rest of the world. Soybeans, meat, poultry, and crude oil are some of the top US goods exported. The map shows the area of the production of these goods and the employment rate near these areas.

- Final Project: 
- Final Project Abstract: This study intends to contribute to the overall knowledge base about how the form of urban spaces affects the crime rate (objective safety) by analyzing Chicago's urban intersection. For this purpose, we focus on the top ten percent of least safe urban blocks intersection and collect a set of significant attributes (such as the height of the buildings, the width of the streets, and tree canopies) associated with morphological contexts of the intersections in the 50-meter buffer area of 3986 intersections in Chicago. Two primary regression analyses are used to assess the correlation of morphologic features and the objective safety: (1): Linear Least Squares Methods (Ordinary Least Squares and Weighted Linear regression model); (2) Cluster and Factor Analysis. The results will be presented in interactive maps and graphics using Tableau.
This project is in line with my thesis project subject.

- Final Project: 
- Final Project Abstract: Social vulnerability exposes the less privileged social group to natural hazards, making them susceptible to undesirable physical and social wellbeing, including death, injury, and loss of livelihood. In hazardous events, whether a natural disaster like flooding, tornado, landslide, disease outbreak or anthropogenic event such as a harmful chemical spill, the effect varies among different socioeconomic groups. It is expedient for cities, communities, and policymakers to be prepared and proactive in response and plan, especially among the vulnerable social class. In this background, this study tends to examine the socioeconomic index of residence in Iowa.

- Final Project Abstract: Chernobyl Disaster, the historical Ukrainian tragedy of April 26, 1986, was the memorable event of the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant Reactor 4 explosion, known as the largest nuclear accident of both the 20th century and of all history. This disaster led to the displacement of around 300,000 people and resulted in an estimated range of 4,000 to 93,000 deaths. Because of this eventâ€™s notoriety and fear bias many people do not understand what exactly happened, the effects from the disaster, or how this relates to and has impacted nuclear power today. Through the use of web mapping, data visualization, and literary review, this project presents both facts and a timeline of events that took place in Chernobyl, Ukraine and the rest of the globe on April 26, 1986. The conclusion then briefly discusses modern nuclear power technologies, locations, and safety in relation to the events of the notorious Chernobyl Disaster.

- Final Project Abstract: Parking shortage has been one of the biggest challenges faced by truck drivers, fleet managers and owner operators for many years The Truck Parking Information Management Systems (TPIMS) project is an innovative multistate effort undertaken by members of the Mid America Association of State Transportation Officials (MAASTO) to address critical truck parking issues affecting regional economic competitiveness and the national freight network's safety and efficiency. To evaluate the performance of the Iowa TPIMS, utilization, demand cycle and reliability are developed and visualized in a dashboard through multidimensional aggregation of parking flow data. Such intuitive tools and results can help agencies evaluate the system and better understand the large dataset to make informed decisions.

- Final Project: 
- Final Project Abstract: This project will seek to track changes at the Ames Chemical Disposal Site dating back to its inception in 1947, from changes in its soil studies and watershed to highlighting unique flora found at the site. Using web mapping, it represents an attempt to consolidate and modernize the scant, cluttered data around a site important for its historical past, ecological present, and future. The ultimate objective of the project will be to create and compile interactive maps and charts created with R, Javascript/Leaflet/etc, historical documentation, and photographs of the modern state of the site into an ArcGIS StoryMap.
